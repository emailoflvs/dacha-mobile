# Working with a mobile application using the REST API and web system to test the work.

The application was built on Lavel 6.
Documentation for working with REST is in Apidoc

Authorization was originally set by Laravel, but then I set bearer-header for rest

There is a lot of code in the controllers and not everything is done beautifully yet, because. the project was unexpectedly closed.
